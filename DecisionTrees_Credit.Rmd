#Develop a simple credit approval model using C5.0 decision trees:

## Prepare and Clean Data

```{r}
credit = read.csv("~/Dropbox/R ref/Machine Learning with R/chapter 5/credit.csv")

str(credit)

table(credit$checking_balance)
table(credit$savings_balance)

summary(credit$months_loan_duration)
summary(credit$amount)

table(credit$default)
```


Randomize and choose training (90%) and test (10%) dataset
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
credit_rand = credit[order(runif(1000)), ]

#chek that randomized stats are still the same but order is different
summary(credit$amount)
summary(credit_rand$amount)
head(credit$amount)
head(credit_rand$amount)

#split into train and test dataset
credit_train = credit_rand[1:900, ]
credit_test = credit_rand[901:1000, ]

#check that ~30% of defaulted loans are in each dataset
prop.table(table(credit_train$default))
prop.table(table(credit_test$default))
```


#Train the Model (using C5.0 C50 package)
```{r}
library(C50)


```
