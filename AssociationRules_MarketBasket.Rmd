###Association Rules
##Identify fequently purchased groceries with association rules

store data as a sparse matrix with a column for each possible item (ignoring brands):

#Explore and prepare data
```{r}
library(arules)

groceries = read.transactions('~/Dropbox/R ref/Machine Learning with R/chapter 8/groceries.csv', sep = ',')

summary(groceries)

inspect(groceries[1:5])

itemFrequency(groceries[,1:3])

itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, support = 0.1)

itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, topN = 20)

image(groceries[1:5])
image(sample(groceries, 100))
```


#Training the Model
```{r}
apriori(groceries)
#zero rules with default (support = 0.1; confidence = 0.8)

#set support to 0.006 (equivalent to 2 purchases/day)

```
