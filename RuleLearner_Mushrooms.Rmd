#Develop a simple credit approval model using C5.0 decision trees:

## Prepare and Clean Data
```{r}
mushrooms = read.csv("~/Dropbox/R ref/Machine Learning with R/chapter 5/mushrooms.csv")

str(mushrooms)

#drop veil_type which only contains one factor level (therefore no info)
mushrooms$veil_type = NULL

#what is the split of the class variable
table(mushrooms$type)
```

In this case we assume the 8214 mushrooms represent all mushrooms thus we will learn from all samples to develop rules for foragers

##Training the Model on the data
###Train the 1R classifier
```{r}
library(RWeka)

mushroom_1R = OneR(type ~ ., data = mushrooms) #. means consider all
mushroom_1R
summary(mushroom_1R)
```


### Improving Model Peformance by adding more rules
```{r}

```
